# **Installing Docker Compose on an Offline Ubuntu PC**  

## **Step 1: Download the Docker Compose Binary**  

Visit the official Docker Compose releases page:  
üîó **[GitHub Releases - Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)**  

Find the latest stable release and download the corresponding binary for Linux.  

Alternatively, use the following command to download it directly:  
```bash
curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.27.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o docker-compose
```  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace `v2.27.1` with the latest version available on the releases page.  

Make the downloaded binary executable:  
```bash
chmod +x docker-compose
```

## **Step 2: Transfer and Install on the Offline PC**  

Copy the `docker-compose` binary to a directory in your system's `$PATH`, such as `/usr/local/bin/`:  
```bash
sudo cp /path/to/docker-compose /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```  

Verify the installation:  
```bash
docker-compose --version
```  

---

## **Step 3: Confirm Docker Compose is Working**  

To ensure Docker Compose works correctly with Docker, run:  
```bash
docker-compose --version
```  

If the version is displayed correctly, Docker Compose is successfully installed on your offline Ubuntu PC. üöÄ
