To install Docker on an offline Windows machine, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Download Docker Installation Files:**
   - On a machine with internet access, download the Docker Desktop installer from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

2. **Download Dependencies:**
   - Docker Desktop has dependencies that need to be installed. These are usually downloaded automatically during the installation, but for an offline installation, you will need to download them manually:
     - **Visual Studio Code** (optional but recommended): Download the installer from the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
     - **WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)**: Docker Desktop relies on WSL 2 on Windows 10 and later. Download the WSL 2 Linux kernel update package from the [Microsoft website](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel).

#### Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux
First, you need to enable the "Windows Subsystem for Linux" optional feature before installing any Linux distributions on Windows.

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator (Start menu > PowerShell > right-click > Run as Administrator).
2. Enter the following command:

    ```powershell
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    ```

#### Enable the Virtual Machine Feature
Before installing WSL 2, you must enable the Virtual Machine Platform optional feature. Your machine will require virtualization capabilities to use this feature.

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
    ```

#### Download the Linux Kernel Update Package
The Linux kernel update package installs the most recent version of the WSL 2 Linux kernel for running WSL inside the Windows operating system image.

1. Download the package from the following link: [Linux kernel update package](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi).
2. Run the installer to update the kernel.

#### Set WSL 2 as the Default Version
To ensure that WSL 2 is used as the default version for new Linux distributions:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator.
2. Run the following command:

    ```powershell
    wsl --set-default-version 2
    ```

3. **Transfer Files to Offline Machine:**
   - Transfer all downloaded files to the offline Windows machine using a USB drive or any other transfer method.

4. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the Visual Studio Code (if you downloaded it) by running the installer.
   - Install the WSL 2 update package by running the installer.

5. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Run the Docker Desktop installer on the offline machine.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

6. **Configure Docker Desktop:**
   - After installation, Docker Desktop might need to be configured to use WSL 2.
   - Open Docker Desktop and go to **Settings**.
   - Under the **General** tab, make sure **Use the WSL 2 based engine** is checked.
   - Under the **Resources** tab, go to **WSL Integration** and ensure the WSL 2 distributions you want Docker to access are enabled.

### Example Steps:

1. **Download Docker Desktop:**
   ```plaintext
   https://desktop.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe
   ```

2. **Download WSL 2 Kernel Update:**
   ```plaintext
   https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi
   ```

3. **Transfer Files:**
   - Copy `Docker Desktop Installer.exe` and `wsl_update_x64.msi` to a USB drive.

4. **Install WSL 2 Update:**
   - Double-click `wsl_update_x64.msi` on the offline machine and follow the installation prompts.

5. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Double-click `Docker Desktop Installer.exe` on the offline machine.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

6. **Configure Docker Desktop to Use WSL 2:**
   - Open Docker Desktop.
   - Go to **Settings** > **General** and check **Use the WSL 2 based engine**.
   - Go to **Resources** > **WSL Integration** and enable the distributions.

After completing these steps, Docker should be installed and running on your offline Windows machine.
