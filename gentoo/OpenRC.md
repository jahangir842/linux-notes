**Gentoo** traditionally uses the **`init.d`** system for managing services, but it also supports **`systemd`** as an optional alternative.

### **Gentoo's Init System:**

- By default, **Gentoo** uses the **`OpenRC`** init system, which is a parallelized init system designed to be simple and flexible. **OpenRC** is typically managed through scripts located in `/etc/init.d/`.
- OpenRC is similar to **`init.d`** (SysVinit) in that it uses shell scripts to manage services, but it also supports parallel service startup, which improves boot times compared to traditional **`init.d`** systems.

### **Can Gentoo Use `systemd`?**

Yes, Gentoo **supports `systemd`** as an alternative init system, but it is not the default. You can install and configure `systemd` on Gentoo if you prefer.

1. **Installing `systemd` on Gentoo**:
   - To switch to **`systemd`** from **OpenRC**, you'll need to install the `systemd` package:
     ```bash
     sudo emerge --ask sys-apps/systemd
     ```
2. **Configuring `systemd`**:
   - You can configure Gentoo to use **`systemd`** by changing the boot system to `systemd` in `/etc/portage/make.conf`:
     ```bash
     # /etc/portage/make.conf
     SYSTEMD=YES
     ```
   - After that, you may need to rebuild or update packages to ensure proper integration with `systemd`.
   
3. **Switching to `systemd`**:
   - Once `systemd` is installed and configured, you can switch from **OpenRC** to **`systemd`** with:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl reboot
     ```

---

### **Summary:**

- **Gentoo's default** init system is **OpenRC**, which is based on the older **`init.d`** approach but with parallel startup capabilities.
- **Gentoo also supports `systemd`**, but it is **optional** and requires manual installation and configuration.
- If you prefer the **`init.d`** system, Gentoo's OpenRC is the closest implementation.
- If you want **`systemd`**, Gentoo allows you to switch over, although OpenRC is often preferred by Gentoo users for its simplicity and flexibility.
