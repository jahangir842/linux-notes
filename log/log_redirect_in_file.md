To run a command and save its output (logs) to a log file, you can use output redirection in the shell. Here's how:

---

### Syntax for Redirecting Logs:
```bash
command > logfile.log 2>&1
```

### Explanation:
- `>`: Redirects standard output (stdout) to a file.
- `2>&1`: Redirects standard error (stderr) to the same location as stdout.
- `logfile.log`: The name of the file where logs will be saved.

---

### Example:
If your command is `ls -l /some/path`, and you want to save the logs to `output.log`:
```bash
ls -l /some/path > output.log 2>&1
```

---

### Alternative: Append to the Log File
If you want to append logs instead of overwriting the file:
```bash
command >> logfile.log 2>&1
```

---

### Run Command and View Logs Simultaneously
If you want to save logs to a file **and** see them in the terminal:
```bash
command | tee logfile.log
```

For both stdout and stderr:
```bash
command 2>&1 | tee logfile.log
```
