To run a command and save its output (logs) to a log file, you can use output redirection in the shell. Here's how:

---

### Syntax for Redirecting Logs:
```bash
command > logfile.log 2>&1
```

### Explanation:
- `>`: Redirects standard output (stdout) to a file.
- `2>&1`: Redirects standard error (stderr) to the same location as stdout.
- `logfile.log`: The name of the file where logs will be saved.

---

### Example:
If your command is `ls -l /some/path`, and you want to save the logs to `output.log`:
```bash
ls -l /some/path > output.log 2>&1
```

---

### Alternative: Append to the Log File
If you want to append logs instead of overwriting the file:
```bash
command >> logfile.log 2>&1
```

---

### Run Command and View Logs Simultaneously
If you want to save logs to a file **and** see them in the terminal:
```bash
command | tee logfile.log
```

For both stdout and stderr:
```bash
command 2>&1 | tee logfile.log
```

The `2>&1` syntax in shell scripting is used for **redirecting standard error (stderr) to the same location as standard output (stdout)**. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### **Key Concepts:**
1. **File Descriptors:**
   - Every process in a Unix-like system has three standard file descriptors:
     - **`0` (stdin):** Standard input, usually from the keyboard.
     - **`1` (stdout):** Standard output, where normal output is sent (e.g., to the terminal).
     - **`2` (stderr):** Standard error, where error messages are sent (e.g., to the terminal).

2. **Redirection Operators:**
   - `>` redirects stdout to a file.
   - `2>` redirects stderr to a file.
   - `&`: This is used to indicate that the file descriptor (like `1` for stdout or `2` for stderr) should be treated as a file descriptor and not a file.

---

### **How `2>&1` Works:**
- **`2>`**: Redirects stderr.
- **`&1`**: Refers to the current location of stdout (file descriptor `1`).

When combined, `2>&1` means:
1. Redirect stderr (`2>`) to wherever stdout (`&1`) is currently directed.
2. If stdout is directed to a file (e.g., `command > logfile.log`), this ensures both stdout and stderr go into `logfile.log`.

---

### **Examples:**

#### 1. Redirect stdout and stderr to a single file:
```bash
command > logfile.log 2>&1
```
- **stdout** (`1`) is redirected to `logfile.log`.
- **stderr** (`2`) is redirected to the same location as stdout (i.e., `logfile.log`).

#### 2. Redirect only stderr to a file:
```bash
command 2> error.log
```
- **stdout** is displayed in the terminal.
- **stderr** is saved in `error.log`.

#### 3. Append logs (stdout and stderr) to a file:
```bash
command >> logfile.log 2>&1
```
- **stdout** is appended to `logfile.log`.
- **stderr** is redirected to the same file.

#### 4. View and save logs simultaneously:
```bash
command 2>&1 | tee logfile.log
```
- **stdout** and **stderr** are both displayed in the terminal.
- Logs are saved to `logfile.log`.

---

### **Why Use `2>&1`?**
- To combine stdout and stderr into a single output (e.g., for debugging or logging).
- To ensure all output (normal or error) is captured in the same log file.
