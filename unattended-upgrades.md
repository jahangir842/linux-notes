The error message indicates that the **`dpkg` lock** file (`/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend`) is currently being held by another process (`25626`), which in this case is the **unattended-upgrades** service. This service runs automatically in the background to update your system's packages without manual intervention. 

This lock mechanism prevents multiple processes from making changes to the package database at the same time, ensuring data integrity.

### **How to Resolve the Issue**

#### **1. Wait for the Lock to Be Released**
- The **unattended-upgrades** process should complete its task shortly and release the lock. You can wait for a few minutes and try running the command again:
  ```bash
  sudo apt upgrade
  ```

---

#### **2. Identify and Monitor the Process**
- Check the status of the process holding the lock:
  ```bash
  ps -p 25626 -o pid,cmd
  ```
- If it is still running, let it complete. 

---

#### **3. Manually Terminate the Process (Not Recommended Unless Necessary)**
If the process seems stuck and you're certain it isn't doing anything critical, you can terminate it:
1. Kill the process:
   ```bash
   sudo kill -9 25626
   ```
2. Remove the lock file:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
   ```
3. Reconfigure `dpkg` in case of inconsistencies:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg --configure -a
   ```
4. Update and upgrade the system:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

---

#### **4. Temporarily Disable `unattended-upgrades`**
If this issue frequently occurs due to **unattended-upgrades**, you can temporarily disable it:
1. Stop the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop unattended-upgrades
   ```
2. Prevent it from running automatically:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl disable unattended-upgrades
   ```
3. Perform the upgrade:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```
4. Re-enable the service if required:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable unattended-upgrades
   ```

### **Conclusion**
This error is generally not critical and often resolves itself after the current process completes. Killing or disabling processes should only be done if absolutely necessary to avoid damaging the package manager or leaving your system in an inconsistent state.
