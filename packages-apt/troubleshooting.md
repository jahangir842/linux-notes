### Problem: `dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.`

### **Solution 1:**
1. **Remove Pending dpkg Updates**  
   ```bash
   cd /var/lib/dpkg/updates
   sudo rm *
   ```
   - This clears all pending update files, which may have been left in an inconsistent state due to an interrupted update.

2. **Update Package Lists**  
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   sudo apt-get autoremove
   ```
   - This cleans up unnecessary packages that were automatically installed but are no longer needed.

### **Alternative Final Steps (if issues persist)**  
If the problem still exists, try running:  
```bash
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```
or  
```bash
sudo apt-get -f install
```
to fix any broken dependencies.

### **Solution 2:**

1. Run the suggested command to complete the pending configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg --configure -a
   ```

2. If the issue persists, try forcefully reconfiguring any broken packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install -f
   ```

3. If there's a specific package causing issues, identify it with:
   ```bash
   dpkg --audit
   ```
   Then, try reconfiguring it individually:
   ```bash
   sudo dpkg --configure <package-name>
   ```

4. If a lock file is preventing `dpkg` from running, release it:
   ```bash
   sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend
   sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
   sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock
   ```

5. If the issue persists, rebuild `dpkg`'s database:
   ```bash
   sudo mv /var/lib/dpkg/status /var/lib/dpkg/status.old
   sudo touch /var/lib/dpkg/status
   sudo apt update
   ```
