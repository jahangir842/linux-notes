### **1. Command-Line System Monitoring Tools in Linux**

Command-line monitoring tools are essential for system administrators and DevOps engineers to keep track of system performance, resource usage, and diagnose issues. These tools are often used in server environments where graphical interfaces are not available. Below is an overview of popular command-line monitoring tools in Linux:

---

### **a. `vmstat` (Virtual Memory Statistics)**
- **Purpose:** Provides an overview of system performance, including memory, processes, CPU activity, and disk I/O statistics.
- **Key Information Provided:**
  - Memory usage (free, used, swap, etc.)
  - Process information (number of processes, blocked processes)
  - CPU usage (user time, system time, idle)
  - System I/O activity (blocks read/written)
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  vmstat 2
  ```
  - This command shows a continuous stream of stats, updated every 2 seconds.
  - **Output Example:**
    ```
    procs -----------memory---------- ---swap-- -----io---- --system-- ----cpu----
    r  b   swpd   free   buff  cache   si  so   bi   bo   in   cs us sy id wa st
    1  0      0  102400  1024  204800    0   0    1    2   123   45  5  4  90  1  0
    ```

### **b. `iostat` (Input/Output Statistics)**
- **Purpose:** Monitors CPU and disk I/O performance. It's useful for identifying disk bottlenecks and understanding the disk activity on the system.
- **Key Information Provided:**
  - CPU usage stats (user, system, idle, etc.)
  - Disk I/O stats (reads, writes, I/O requests)
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  iostat -x 2
  ```
  - `-x` gives extended statistics, and `2` specifies the interval in seconds between updates.
  - **Output Example:**
    ```
    Linux 5.8.0-53-generic (hostname)  12/05/2024  _x86_64_  (2 CPU)
    
    Device            r/s     w/s    rkB/s   wkB/s   util
    sda               2.5     1.2     100     60      2.3
    ```

### **c. `sar` (System Activity Report)**
- **Purpose:** Collects, reports, or saves system activity information over time. It provides a historical view of system performance.
- **Key Information Provided:**
  - CPU, memory, network, disk I/O, and other resource statistics.
  - Data can be saved to files for later analysis.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  sar -u 2
  ```
  - This command shows CPU usage stats every 2 seconds.
  - **Output Example:**
    ```
    Linux 5.8.0-53-generic (hostname)  12/05/2024  _x86_64_  (2 CPU)
    
    12:05:01 AM     CPU     %user     %nice   %system   %iowait    %steal   %idle
    12:05:03 AM     all      20.01      0.00      5.11      0.16      0.00     74.72
    ```

### **d. `nmon` (Nigel's Monitor)**
- **Purpose:** A powerful tool for monitoring CPU, memory, network, disk, and other system performance metrics. It can collect data over time and display graphs in real-time.
- **Key Information Provided:**
  - CPU, memory, network, disk, file systems, and process information.
  - Can output data for later analysis (CSV format).
- **Installation:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt install nmon
  ```
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  nmon
  ```
  - To monitor specific resources, press keys (e.g., `c` for CPU, `m` for memory).
  - **Output Example:** Provides a comprehensive view with options to toggle between different stats.

### **e. `free`**
- **Purpose:** Displays memory usage statistics for both physical RAM and swap space.
- **Key Information Provided:**
  - Total memory, used memory, free memory, buffer cache, swap usage.
  - Helps monitor memory pressure and swap usage.
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  free -h
  ```
  - `-h` provides output in human-readable format (e.g., MB, GB).
  - **Output Example:**
    ```
                  total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
    Mem:            8GB         4GB         1GB        200MB        2GB         2.5GB
    Swap:           2GB         0GB         2GB
    ```

### **Summary:**
- **For CPU and memory monitoring:** Use tools like `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, and `free`.
- **For disk I/O monitoring:** Use `iostat`, `iotop`, and `dstat`.
- **For network monitoring:** Use `iftop`, `netstat`, and `nload`.
- **For real-time activity and performance:** `nmon`, `sar`, and `dstat` are excellent choices.

Command-line monitoring tools are essential for quickly identifying performance bottlenecks and understanding system resource usage in real-time. They are lightweight and efficient, making them ideal for servers or systems where GUI-based tools may not be available.
