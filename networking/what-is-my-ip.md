To find your public IP address from the command line in Linux, you can use one of the following commands:

### 1. Using `curl`
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

### 2. Using `dig` (part of the `bind-utils` package)
```bash
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```

### 3. Using `wget`
```bash
wget -qO- ifconfig.me
```

### 4. Using `curl` with `icanhazip`
```bash
curl -4 icanhazip.com
```

These commands query a remote service to return your public IP address.
