The `ip link` command is part of the `ip` command suite in Linux, which is used for network management. Specifically, `ip link` is used to display and modify network interface information.

### Usage of `ip link` Command

- **Display Information:**
  - Running `ip link` without any arguments will display information about all the network interfaces on the system, such as their name, MAC address, MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit), and status (up or down).
  
  ```bash
  ip link
  ```

  **Example Output:**
  ```bash
  1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
      link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00
  2: enp0s3: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
      link/ether 08:00:27:34:12:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
  ```

  - `lo` is the loopback interface.
  - `enp0s3` is a typical Ethernet interface.

- **Bring an Interface Up or Down:**
  - To bring a network interface up (activate it):
  
  ```bash
  ip link set dev <interface_name> up
  ```

  - To bring a network interface down (deactivate it):

  ```bash
  ip link set dev <interface_name> down
  ```

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  ip link set dev enp0s3 up
  ip link set dev enp0s3 down
  ```

- **Change MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):**
  - You can change the MTU size for a network interface using the following command:

  ```bash
  ip link set dev <interface_name> mtu <mtu_size>
  ```

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  ip link set dev enp0s3 mtu 1400
  ```

- **Change MAC Address:**
  - To change the MAC address of a network interface:

  ```bash
  ip link set dev <interface_name> address <new_mac_address>
  ```

  **Example:**
  ```bash
  ip link set dev enp0s3 address 00:11:22:33:44:55
  ```

### Practical Examples

1. **Display Network Interfaces:**
   ```bash
   ip link
   ```
   This command lists all network interfaces and their current states.

2. **Bring Down the Ethernet Interface:**
   ```bash
   ip link set dev enp0s3 down
   ```
   This command deactivates the `enp0s3` network interface.

3. **Bring Up the Ethernet Interface:**
   ```bash
   ip link set dev enp0s3 up
   ```
   This command reactivates the `enp0s3` network interface.

4. **Change the MTU of a Network Interface:**
   ```bash
   ip link set dev enp0s3 mtu 1400
   ```
   This command sets the MTU of the `enp0s3` network interface to 1400 bytes.

5. **Change the MAC Address of an Interface:**
   ```bash
   ip link set dev enp0s3 address 00:11:22:33:44:55
   ```
   This command assigns a new MAC address to the `enp0s3` network interface.

### Summary

The `ip link` command is a powerful tool for managing and configuring network interfaces in Linux. It allows you to view, modify, and manage the state and configuration of network interfaces on your system.

## `ip link add`

The `ip link add` command is part of the `ip` suite from the `iproute2` package, used for network configuration and management in Linux. This command is specifically used to create (or add) new network interfaces on a system. The `ip link add` command is highly versatile and can be used to create various types of interfaces, such as virtual Ethernet devices, bridges, tunnels, and more.

#### Basic Syntax
```bash
ip link add [name] type [TYPE] [options]
```

- **`name`**: Specifies the name of the new network interface (e.g., `wg0`, `veth0`, `br0`).
- **`type [TYPE]`**: Indicates the type of the network interface being created (e.g., `veth`, `bridge`, `bond`, `wireguard`).

#### Common Interface Types and Examples

1. **Virtual Ethernet (veth)**
   - A `veth` (virtual Ethernet) pair is a connected pair of virtual interfaces. Packets transmitted on one interface of the pair are immediately received on the other interface.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1
     ```
     This command creates two interconnected virtual interfaces `veth0` and `veth1`.

2. **Bridge (br)**
   - A bridge is used to forward traffic between different network segments. It operates at the data link layer.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo ip link add br0 type bridge
     ```
     This creates a network bridge named `br0`.

3. **Bonding**
   - Bonding allows multiple network interfaces to be combined into a single interface to increase bandwidth or provide redundancy.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo ip link add bond0 type bond
     ```
     This creates a bonding interface named `bond0`.

4. **WireGuard**
   - WireGuard is a modern VPN protocol, and this type creates a WireGuard interface.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard
     ```
     This creates a WireGuard interface named `wg0`.

5. **Tunnel**
   - Various tunnel interfaces like `gre`, `sit`, and `ipip` can also be created using this command.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     sudo ip link add mytunnel0 type gre remote 192.0.2.1 local 192.0.2.2
     ```
     This creates a GRE tunnel named `mytunnel0`.

#### Additional Options
- **`netns [namespace]`**: Specifies the network namespace in which the interface will be created.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    sudo ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1 netns mynamespace
    ```
    This creates a `veth` pair with one end in the default namespace and the other in `mynamespace`.

- **`mtu [size]`**: Sets the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) for the interface.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    sudo ip link add br0 type bridge mtu 1500
    ```

- **`txqueuelen [length]`**: Sets the transmit queue length of the interface.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    sudo ip link add bond0 type bond txqueuelen 1000
    ```

#### Common Use Cases
- **Creating Virtual Interfaces for Containers**: 
  The `veth` pair is commonly used to connect a container to a bridge or directly to the host's network namespace.
  
- **Setting Up VPNs**: 
  The `wireguard` type is used to establish a VPN tunnel with modern cryptography.
  
- **Network Namespace Separation**:
  Interfaces can be moved to different network namespaces to isolate network traffic for security or testing.

#### Example Workflow: Creating a WireGuard Interface

1. **Create the WireGuard Interface**:
   ```bash
   sudo ip link add dev wg0 type wireguard
   ```
2. **Configure the Interface**:
   ```bash
   sudo wg set wg0 private-key /etc/wireguard/privatekey
   ```
3. **Bring Up the Interface**:
   ```bash
   sudo ip link set wg0 up
   ```
4. **Assign an IP Address**:
   ```bash
   sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev wg0
   ```

These notes should provide a comprehensive understanding of how to use the `ip link add` command to create various network interfaces on a Linux system.
