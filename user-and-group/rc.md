The **"rc"** in **`.bashrc`** stands for **"run commands"** or **"resource configuration"**. It is a naming convention used in Unix-like systems to denote configuration files that are executed when a program starts or initializes. 

### **Key Points:**
1. **Historical Context**:
   - The term "rc" originates from the **"runcom"** (run command) facility in the early **CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System)** and later in **Unix**.
   - It referred to a script or set of instructions that the system executed to initialize an environment or perform specific tasks.

2. **Modern Usage**:
   - In **`.bashrc`**, the file contains **commands** and **settings** that the **Bash shell** runs or sources to configure an interactive, non-login shell.
   - The naming convention is also used for other configuration files, such as:
     - `.vimrc` for Vim configuration.
     - `.zshrc` for Zsh shell configuration.
     - `.screenrc` for GNU Screen configuration.

3. **Practical Meaning**:
   - **`.bashrc`** essentially means "the file where Bash reads its **run commands** or configuration" when initializing a non-login shell.

By extension, **"rc"** files are generally user-editable configuration files intended to customize the behavior of various programs.
