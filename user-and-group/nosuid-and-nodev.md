### 1. **Introduction to `nosuid` and `nodev`**

In Linux, file systems can be mounted with various options to enhance security and control behavior. Two commonly used options are:

- **`nosuid`**: Prevents the execution of programs with the SUID (Set User ID) or SGID (Set Group ID) bits set.
- **`nodev`**: Prevents the interpretation of device files (e.g., block or character device files).

These options are particularly useful in securing non-root file systems, such as removable media or network file systems, from misuse or malicious exploitation.

---

### 2. **`nosuid` Option**

#### **What It Does:**
- The `nosuid` option disables the SUID and SGID bits on executables within the mounted file system. 
- SUID and SGID allow an executable file to run with the privileges of its owner or group, which can lead to privilege escalation if misused.

#### **Why Use It:**
- To prevent privilege escalation by untrusted users or programs.
- Useful for mounting user-accessible directories like `/home`, `/tmp`, or removable media (e.g., USB drives) where SUID programs should not be trusted.

#### **Example Usage:**
```bash
mount -o nosuid /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
```

#### **Behavior:**
- If an executable with SUID/SGID is present in the mounted file system, the bits will be ignored, and the program will run with the privileges of the invoking user, not the owner.

#### **Scenarios Where It's Used:**
- Mounting network file systems (e.g., NFS, CIFS).
- Mounting external storage (e.g., USB drives).
- Mounting directories intended for unprivileged users.

---

### 3. **`nodev` Option**

#### **What It Does:**
- The `nodev` option prevents the interpretation of special device files (e.g., `/dev/null`, `/dev/sda`) on the mounted file system.
- Device files are used to interact with hardware or kernel subsystems.

#### **Why Use It:**
- To prevent users from creating or accessing malicious device files that could compromise the system.
- Useful for file systems where device files are unnecessary, such as user home directories or temporary directories.

#### **Example Usage:**
```bash
mount -o nodev /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
```

#### **Behavior:**
- If a special device file exists in the mounted file system, attempts to interact with it will fail.

#### **Scenarios Where It's Used:**
- Mounting user-accessible directories like `/home` or `/tmp`.
- Mounting network file systems or removable media.
- Ensuring that an untrusted file system cannot interact with kernel devices.

---

### 4. **Combined Usage of `nosuid` and `nodev`**

It is common to use both options together to secure non-root file systems. This combination ensures that:
- No SUID/SGID programs can run from the file system.
- No device files can be created or used within the file system.

#### **Example Usage:**
```bash
mount -o nosuid,nodev /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
```

#### **Scenarios for Combined Usage:**
- Removable media (`/mnt/usb` or `/media`).
- Temporary directories (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`).
- User home directories (`/home` in shared environments).

---

### 5. **When NOT to Use `nosuid` and `nodev`**

#### `nosuid`:
- Do not use on root (`/`) or system-critical file systems where SUID/SGID binaries (e.g., `sudo`) are required.

#### `nodev`:
- Do not use on file systems that must access device files, such as `/dev` or file systems mounted specifically for device access.

---

### 6. **Configuration in `/etc/fstab`**

You can permanently set `nosuid` and `nodev` options in the `/etc/fstab` file for specific file systems. Example entry:
```plaintext
/dev/sdb1  /mnt/usb  ext4  defaults,nosuid,nodev  0  2
```

This ensures the options are applied automatically at boot or when the file system is mounted.

---

### 7. **Security Implications**

- **`nosuid`**: Reduces the risk of privilege escalation from malicious or untrusted programs on the mounted file system.
- **`nodev`**: Prevents exploitation of device files to interact with the kernel or hardware maliciously.
- Together, they significantly enhance the security of non-root and user-accessible file systems.

---

### 8. **Verification**

To verify the mount options applied to a file system, use:
```bash
mount | grep <mount-point>
```

Example output:
```plaintext
/dev/sdb1 on /mnt/usb type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev)
```

---

### 9. **Conclusion**

- The `nosuid` and `nodev` options are critical for securing file systems where users have write access or when dealing with untrusted storage.
- Use them proactively in environments where multiple users share the system or external file systems are involved.
