## The error message:

```bash

Kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)

The VirtualBox Linux kernel driver is either not loaded or not set up correctly. Please try setting it up again by executing

'/sbin/vboxconfig'

as root.

If your system has EFI Secure Boot enabled you may also need to sign the kernel modules (vboxdrv, vboxnetflt, vboxnetadp, vboxpci) before you can load them. Please see your Linux system's documentation for more information.

where: suplibOsInit what: 3 VERR_VM_DRIVER_NOT_INSTALLED (-1908) - The support driver is not installed. On linux, open returned ENOENT.

## Solution:

### 1. Install GCC 12

It seems that `gcc-12` is missing or not installed properly on your system. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc-12 g++-12
```

### 2. Set GCC 12 as the Default Compiler

Once `gcc-12` is installed, you may need to set it as the default compiler if it's not already. You can use the `update-alternatives` tool to do this:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-12 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-12 100
```

Then, configure the default version:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
sudo update-alternatives --config g++
```

This will prompt you to select the default version of GCC and G++ from a list.

### 3. Verify the GCC Version

Check if the correct GCC version is set:

```bash
gcc --version
```

It should show **GCC 12**.

### 4. Retry Building VirtualBox Kernel Modules

Now that GCC is correctly installed and set as the default, try rebuilding the VirtualBox kernel modules:

```bash
sudo /sbin/vboxconfig
```

This should compile the modules using GCC 12 and resolve the error.

### 5. Additional Troubleshooting

If you still face issues after these steps, ensure that you have all the required build dependencies. You can install the necessary packages by running:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

This ensures that the kernel headers and essential build tools are installed.

Let me know if this resolves your issue or if you need further assistance!
