### Named Volume vs Bind Volume

The difference between in Docker volume syntax lies in the type of volume being used and its implications:

Find the difference between following two types:
```
./redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files
and 
redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files
```

1. **`./redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files`**: This is a **bind mount**.
2. **`redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files`**: This is a **named volume**.

### Bind Mounts

**Syntax**: `./redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files`

- **Definition**: Bind mounts link a directory on the host filesystem to a directory in the container. The path on the left side (`./redmine_data`) is the directory on the host, and the path on the right side (`/usr/src/redmine/files`) is the directory in the container.
- **Usage**: `docker run -v ./redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files ...`
- **Host-Dependency**: The data is stored directly on the host filesystem and is tied to the host directory specified. If you move or rename the directory on the host, the bind mount will break.
- **Advantages**:
  - Immediate reflection of changes on the host filesystem within the container.
  - Useful for development environments where you want real-time updates.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Less portable as it depends on the specific host directory structure.
  - Security concerns since the container has direct access to the host filesystem.

### Named Volumes

**Syntax**: `redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files`

- **Definition**: Named volumes are managed by Docker and stored in Docker's storage area (typically `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on Linux). The name on the left side (`redmine_data`) is the name of the Docker-managed volume, and the path on the right side (`/usr/src/redmine/files`) is the directory in the container.
- **Usage**: `docker run -v redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files ...`
- **Host-Independent**: The data is stored in Docker's volume storage area, making it independent of the host's directory structure.
- **Advantages**:
  - Portability across different hosts since Docker manages the volume.
  - Easier volume management and lifecycle handling via Docker commands.
  - Improved security as the container does not directly access the host filesystem.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Changes are not immediately reflected on the host filesystem.
  - Slightly less intuitive for users who prefer direct access to files on the host.

### Detailed Comparison Example

Let's consider a scenario where you are running a Redmine container and need to persist data in the `files` directory.

#### Using Bind Mount

**Docker Run Command**:
```sh
docker run -d -v ./redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files redmine
```

- **Host Directory**: `./redmine_data` (relative to the current working directory).
- **Container Directory**: `/usr/src/redmine/files`.

**Implications**:
- Any changes to the `./redmine_data` directory on the host will be immediately visible inside the container at `/usr/src/redmine/files`.
- If you delete or move `./redmine_data` on the host, the bind mount breaks.

#### Using Named Volume

**Create Volume** (if not already created):
```sh
docker volume create redmine_data
```

**Docker Run Command**:
```sh
docker run -d -v redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files redmine
```

- **Named Volume**: `redmine_data`.
- **Container Directory**: `/usr/src/redmine/files`.

**Implications**:
- Docker manages the storage location of `redmine_data` (e.g., `/var/lib/docker/volumes/redmine_data/_data`).
- The volume is portable and can be easily moved between hosts using Docker commands.
- To access the volume data, you typically use `docker cp` or run a temporary container to explore the volume.

### Conclusion

- **Use Bind Mounts (`./redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files`)**:
  - When you need direct access to the data on the host filesystem.
  - For development environments requiring real-time updates.
  - Be aware of the security and portability limitations.

- **Use Named Volumes (`redmine_data:/usr/src/redmine/files`)**:
  - For production environments where data needs to persist independently of the host directory structure.
  - When you need the flexibility of Docker-managed storage.
  - To leverage Docker's volume management features for backup, restore, and sharing across multiple containers.

Choosing between bind mounts and named volumes depends on your specific use case, considering factors such as development vs. production, need for real-time updates, portability, and security.
