# 🧠 NVIDIA TAO Toolkit

The **NVIDIA TAO Toolkit** is a low-code AI development framework built on **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**. It simplifies the complexity of model training, optimization, and deployment by providing a streamlined command-line interface and APIs for transfer learning and deployment on NVIDIA GPUs.

---

## 📌 What is TAO?

**TAO** stands for "**Train, Adapt, Optimize**".

* Offers pre-trained models and workflows for object detection, classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and more.
* Designed for **enterprise-grade AI** and **edge deployment**, enabling data scientists and developers to accelerate AI model development using transfer learning.
* Supports minimal-code training through declarative spec files, suitable for both cloud and on-premise environments.

> “TAO = A Sample Notebook” — NVIDIA provides ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks to simplify development.

## 🛠 Usage Overview

TAO Toolkit is accessible via:

* **TAO CLI** (Docker-based interface)
* **TAO Launcher** (Python virtual environment)

This guide assumes the TAO Launcher and TAO CLI are installed and configured. Separate guides cover the installation procedures for both.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 20.04+ (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
* NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
* Docker (required for some workflows)
* Python 3.8–3.10
* `ngc` CLI installed and configured

> For help installing the NGC CLI, see the [NGC CLI Installation Guide](https://github.com/jahangir842/linux-notes/blob/main/GPU/nvidia-tao/install-ngc-cli.md).

---

## 📦 Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone TAO Tutorials

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/tao_tutorials.git
cd tao_tutorials
```

### Step 2: Activate TAO Environment and Run Commands

Example of running a training command via TAO Launcher environment:

```bash
source /opt/tao-venv/bin/activate
tao detectnet_v2 train -e /path/to/spec.yaml
```

## 📁 Typical Directory Structure

```bash
/opt/tao-venv/        # Python virtual environment for TAO Launcher
~/.tao/               # TAO cache and configuration files
~/tao_tutorials/      # Sample training workflows and Jupyter notebooks
```

---

## 🚀 Running a Model Example

To run a model training session inside the TAO Launcher environment:

```bash
tao detectnet_v2 run /bin/bash
```

Then inside the container shell:

```bash
detectnet_v2 train -e /path/to/experiment_spec.yaml
```
