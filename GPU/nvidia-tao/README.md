# 🧠 NVIDIA TAO Toolkit

The **NVIDIA TAO Toolkit** is a low-code AI development framework built on **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**. It abstracts away the complexity of model training, optimization, and deployment by providing a simple command-line interface and set of APIs for transfer learning and deployment on NVIDIA GPUs.

---

## 📌 What is TAO?

**TAO** stands for "**Train, Adapt, Optimize**".

- It provides pre-trained models and workflows for object detection, classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and more.
- Built for **enterprise-grade AI** and **edge deployment**, it helps data scientists and developers accelerate AI model development using transfer learning.
- It supports training with minimal code using a declarative spec file and is designed for both cloud and on-premise systems.

> “TAO = A Sample Notebook” — NVIDIA simplifies development via ready-to-run Jupyter notebooks.

## 🛠 Installation Overview

TAO Toolkit can be used via:

- **TAO CLI** (Docker-based)
- **TAO Launcher** (Python virtual environment)

In this guide, we focus on the **TAO Launcher**, installed in:

```bash
/opt/tao-venv
```

Make sure your system meets the following:

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 20.04+ (Ubuntu 22.04 recommended)
* NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
* Docker (for some workflows)
* Python 3.8–3.10
* `ngc` CLI installed and configured

> For help installing NGC CLI, refer to the [NGC CLI Installation Guide](#).

---

## 📦 Quick Start

### Step 1: Clone TAO Tutorials

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/tao_tutorials.git
cd tao_tutorials
```

### Step 2: Launch Notebook or Scripts

You can run example notebooks or scripts directly using the preconfigured launcher.

Example:

```bash
source /opt/tao-venv/bin/activate
tao detectnet_v2 train -e /path/to/spec.yaml
```

## 📁 TAO Launcher Directory Structure

After installation, files typically reside in:

```bash
/opt/tao-venv/        # Python virtual environment for TAO Launcher
~/.tao/               # TAO cache and configuration
~/tao_tutorials/      # Sample training workflows and notebooks
```

---

## 🚀 Run Your First Model

```bash
tao detectnet_v2 run /bin/bash
```

Then inside the container:

```bash
detectnet_v2 train -e /path/to/experiment_spec.yaml
```
