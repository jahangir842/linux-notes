**`manylinux`** is a standardized set of Linux distributions and ABI (Application Binary Interface) compatibility layers defined by the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA). It is used in Python package distribution to ensure that precompiled Python binary packages (called "wheels") can work across a wide range of Linux distributions without requiring users to build the package from source.

---

### **Why `manylinux`?**
When Python packages include compiled components (e.g., C/C++ extensions), the compiled binaries are often specific to the Linux distribution where they were built. This creates compatibility issues because the target user's Linux system may not have the same libraries or versions.

The `manylinux` standard solves this by ensuring:
1. **Binary Compatibility**: A `manylinux` wheel will work across most modern Linux distributions.
2. **Ease of Use**: Users can install the package without needing to compile it, saving time and avoiding dependency issues.

---

### **How `manylinux` Works**
- The `manylinux` wheels are built in a specially configured environment, like a CentOS Docker image, which ensures compatibility with a wide range of Linux distributions.
- It uses older versions of system libraries (like `glibc`) to ensure compatibility with newer Linux distributions while maintaining backward compatibility with older ones.

When you install a `manylinux` wheel via `pip`, it bypasses the need to compile the package from source, speeding up the process.

### **Versions of `manylinux`**
Each version corresponds to a certain minimum version of Linux system libraries, especially `glibc`:

| Version               | Minimum `glibc` Version | Compatible Distributions            |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **manylinux1**        | `glibc 2.5`            | CentOS 5 and newer (EOL)           |
| **manylinux2010**     | `glibc 2.12`           | CentOS 6 and newer (EOL)           |
| **manylinux2014**     | `glibc 2.17`           | CentOS 7 and newer                 |
| **manylinux_2_28**    | `glibc 2.28`           | Modern distros like Ubuntu 20.04+  |

The higher the `manylinux` version, the newer the Linux libraries it supports, but the fewer older distributions it will support.

### **How to Use `manylinux` Wheels**
1. **For Package Users**:
   - When you run `pip install`, `pip` automatically attempts to download a compatible `manylinux` wheel if available.
   - For example, `pip install numpy` will download a `manylinux` wheel for Linux systems.

2. **For Package Developers**:
   - You can build `manylinux` wheels using tools like:
     - **`auditwheel`**: To repair and certify a wheel as `manylinux` compatible.
     - **Preconfigured Docker Images**: Provided by PyPA for building `manylinux` wheels (e.g., `quay.io/pypa/manylinux2014_x86_64`).

---

### **Key Benefits**
- **Cross-Distribution Compatibility**: One `manylinux` wheel works on many Linux distributions.
- **Ease of Installation**: Users can install precompiled packages without dealing with compilers or dependencies.
- **Improved Performance**: No need to compile on installation, which speeds up the process.

---

### **Example**
If a Python package like `pandas` provides a `manylinux2014_x86_64` wheel, it means that:
- It was built in a compatible environment.
- It will work on most Linux distributions with `glibc >= 2.17` (e.g., CentOS 7, Ubuntu 18.04+, etc.).
