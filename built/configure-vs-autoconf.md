Both `configure` and `autoconf` are tools commonly used in building and installing software from source on Linux/Unix systems. They are part of the GNU build system and are related but serve different purposes in the build process. Below is an explanation of each:

---

### **1. `autoconf`**
- **What it is**: `autoconf` is a tool used by developers to create `configure` scripts.
- **Purpose**: It generates a portable and customizable `configure` script based on a template file (`configure.ac` or `configure.in`) written by the developer.
- **How it works**:
  - Developers describe their software's build requirements in a `configure.ac` file.
  - They then run `autoconf`, which processes `configure.ac` and generates the `configure` script.
- **Who uses it**: Developers who are distributing source code that needs to be built on various systems.

**Example of creating a configure script**:
```bash
autoconf
# Generates a configure script from configure.ac
```

**Common use case**:
- To generate a `configure` script that is portable and can adapt to different environments.

---

### **2. `configure`**
- **What it is**: `configure` is a shell script that is typically generated by `autoconf`.
- **Purpose**: It is used by end-users to prepare a source code package for building on their system. It checks the build environment (e.g., compiler, libraries, paths) and generates the necessary Makefiles.
- **How it works**:
  - When you run `./configure`, it tests your system's environment for compatibility and sets up the build system accordingly.
  - It customizes the software for the specific system by generating Makefiles with appropriate paths, options, and compiler flags.

**Common steps for end-users**:
```bash
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install
```

**Options for `configure`**:
- `--prefix`: Specifies the installation directory.
- `--enable-feature`: Enables an optional feature.
- `--disable-feature`: Disables an optional feature.

### **Key Differences**

| **Aspect**          | **`autoconf`**                                          | **`configure`**                                   |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Role**            | Generates the `configure` script.                       | Configures the source code to be built on a system. |
| **Used By**         | Developers creating software packages.                  | End-users building software from source.         |
| **Input**           | `configure.ac` or `configure.in`.                       | Command-line arguments (e.g., `--prefix`).       |
| **Output**          | A portable `configure` script.                          | System-specific Makefiles and configuration.     |
| **When to Use**     | When developing or distributing software.               | When building software from source.              |

### **Workflow Overview**
For a developer:
1. Write a `configure.ac` file.
2. Run `autoconf` to generate the `configure` script.
3. Distribute the source code along with the `configure` script.

For an end-user:
1. Run the `configure` script to prepare the source code for their system.
2. Compile the software using `make`.
3. Install the software using `make install`.

---

### **Example Workflow**

**For Developers (Using `autoconf`):**
1. Write a `configure.ac` file:
   ```bash
   AC_INIT([myprogram], [1.0])
   AC_PROG_CC
   AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
   AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile])
   AC_OUTPUT
   ```
2. Generate the `configure` script:
   ```bash
   autoconf
   ```
3. Distribute the code with the `configure` script.

**For End-Users (Using `configure`):**
1. Download the source package.
2. Run the `configure` script:
   ```bash
   ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
   ```
3. Build and install the program:
   ```bash
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

### **Conclusion**
- `autoconf` is for **developers** to create `configure` scripts.
- `configure` is for **end-users** to prepare the build environment for compiling and installing software.
