# **Understanding Debugging Symbols and Stripping in Linux**

## **1. What Are Debugging Symbols?**
Debugging symbols contain information that helps developers debug programs. When a program or library is compiled with debugging enabled (`gcc -g` option), the compiled binary includes additional metadata about functions, variables, and memory addresses.

### **Advantages of Debugging Symbols:**
- Provides function and variable names in debugging sessions.
- Allows tools like `gdb` (GNU Debugger) and `valgrind` to analyze and troubleshoot issues.
- Helps track down segmentation faults and memory leaks.

### **Disadvantages of Debugging Symbols:**
- **Larger binary size:** Debug symbols significantly increase the file size of executables and libraries.
- **Consumes disk space:** This is a concern for production systems where debugging is not required.

#### **Example of Space Usage**
| File | With Debug Symbols | Without Debug Symbols | Reduction |
|------|------------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Bash binary | 1200 KB | 480 KB | 60% smaller |
| Glibc & GCC files | 87 MB | 16 MB | 82% smaller |

## **2. Stripping Debugging Symbols**
If debugging is not required, binaries can be **stripped** of their debugging symbols to reduce their size. This process is **optional** but beneficial for saving disk space.

### **Stripping with `strip` Command**
The `strip` command removes debugging symbols and unnecessary symbol table entries.

#### **Syntax**
```bash
strip --strip-unneeded <binary_or_library>
```

#### **Explanation of `strip` Options**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--strip-unneeded` | Removes debugging symbols and symbol table entries not needed for execution. |
| `--strip-debug` | Removes only debugging symbols, keeping symbols needed for relocation. |
| `--strip-all` | Removes all symbols, including function names (not recommended for shared libraries). |

#### **Example Usage**
```bash
# Strip unnecessary symbols from a binary
strip --strip-unneeded /usr/bin/bash

# Strip unnecessary symbols from a shared library
strip --strip-unneeded /usr/lib/libc.so.6
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Stripping symbols overwrites the file, which may break running processes. Always **backup important binaries** before stripping.

---

## **3. Safer Approach to Stripping**
To avoid corrupting a running system, it's recommended to **copy** binaries to `/tmp`, strip them, and then move them back using the `install` command.

### **Example: Safe Stripping**
```bash
# Copy to a temporary location
cp /usr/bin/bash /tmp/bash

# Strip symbols in /tmp
strip --strip-unneeded /tmp/bash

# Move back safely
install -m 755 /tmp/bash /usr/bin/bash
```

---

## **4. Storing Debugging Symbols Separately**
Instead of stripping symbols completely, debugging symbols can be **stored in separate files** for later debugging.

### **Example: Extract Debugging Symbols**
```bash
objcopy --only-keep-debug /usr/bin/bash /usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/bash.debug
strip --strip-unneeded /usr/bin/bash
objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/bash.debug /usr/bin/bash
```
This allows `gdb` to use debugging symbols when needed, while keeping binaries smaller.

---

## **5. When Should You Strip Debug Symbols?**
### ‚úÖ **Recommended When:**
- You are deploying software on **production systems** where debugging is unnecessary.
- Disk space is **a concern** (e.g., embedded systems, containers).
- Performance needs **to be optimized** (smaller binaries can load faster).

### ‚ùå **Not Recommended When:**
- You are **developing or debugging software**.
- You need **detailed crash reports** for troubleshooting.
- Running **test environments** where debugging tools like `gdb` or `valgrind` are used.

---

## **6. Summary**
- Debugging symbols **help troubleshoot** software issues but increase binary size.
- The `strip` command **removes debugging symbols**, reducing file size.
- **Use `strip --strip-unneeded`** to safely remove unnecessary symbols.
- **Backup binaries** before stripping to avoid breaking the system.
- Consider **extracting debugging symbols separately** instead of removing them completely.
