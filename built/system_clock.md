# **Configuring the System Clock in Linux From Scratch (LFS)**  

## **1. Understanding the System Clock and Hardware Clock**  
Linux systems use two types of clocks:  
- **System Clock (Software Clock):** The time maintained by the Linux kernel after booting.  
- **Hardware Clock (BIOS/CMOS Clock):** A clock in the systemâ€™s hardware (motherboard) that keeps time even when the computer is powered off.  

The **setclock** script reads the time from the **hardware clock (CMOS/BIOS)** and adjusts it based on system settings.  

---

## **2. UTC vs Local Time for the Hardware Clock**  
The **hardware clock** can be set to either:  
- **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time):** Recommended for most systems, as it avoids time shift issues during daylight saving changes.  
- **Local Time:** Used mainly for dual-boot systems with Windows, which expects the hardware clock to be in local time.  

### **How to Check if the Hardware Clock is Set to UTC or Local Time?**  
Run the following command:  
```bash
hwclock --localtime --show
```
- If the displayed time matches your local time, the hardware clock is set to **local time**.  
- If the displayed time is different, it is likely set to **UTC**. To confirm, manually add/subtract your time zone offset.  

For example, if you are in **MST (GMT -7)**:  
- If the hardware clock shows **12:00 UTC**, your local time should be **5:00 MST**.

## **3. Configuring the System Clock in LFS**  
To specify whether the hardware clock is set to UTC or local time, create or modify the `/etc/sysconfig/clock` file.  

### **Steps to Configure UTC or Local Time**  
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to create the file:  
   ```bash
   cat > /etc/sysconfig/clock << "EOF"
   # Begin /etc/sysconfig/clock
   UTC=1
   # Set this to any options you might need to give to hwclock,
   # such as machine hardware clock type for Alphas.
   CLOCKPARAMS=
   # End /etc/sysconfig/clock
   EOF
   ```
2. **Set `UTC=1` if the hardware clock is set to UTC.**  
3. **Change `UTC=0` if the hardware clock is set to local time.**  

> **Note:** The **CLOCKPARAMS** variable can be used for additional `hwclock` parameters if needed.  

---

## **4. Storing the System Time to the Hardware Clock**  
The `setclock` program is executed via **udev** when the kernel detects the hardware clock at boot. However, you can manually synchronize the system time to the hardware clock using:  
```bash
hwclock --systohc
```
This ensures that the hardware clock reflects the current system time.  

If the hardware clock is set to local time, use:  
```bash
hwclock --systohc --localtime
```

---

## **5. Additional Configuration (rc.site File)**  
In some LFS setups, the `CLOCKPARAMS` and `UTC` values can also be configured in:  
```bash
/etc/sysconfig/rc.site
```
This file may override the `/etc/sysconfig/clock` settings.

## **7. Summary of Key Commands**  
| **Command** | **Description** |  
|------------|--------------|  
| `hwclock --localtime --show` | Check if hardware clock is set to local time. |  
| `hwclock --systohc` | Sync system time to hardware clock (UTC). |  
| `hwclock --systohc --localtime` | Sync system time to hardware clock (local time). |  
| `cat > /etc/sysconfig/clock << "EOF"` | Create or edit the system clock configuration file. |
