A **`.so` (Shared Object) file** in Linux is a **shared library** that contains compiled code that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously. These files are similar to **DLL (Dynamic Link Library) files in Windows**.

---

### **Key Features of `.so` Files**
âœ… **Shared across multiple programs** â†’ Helps reduce memory usage.  
âœ… **Dynamically loaded at runtime** â†’ No need to include the code in every executable.  
âœ… **Versioning support** â†’ Common in system libraries (`libxyz.so.1`, `libxyz.so.2`).  

---

### **Common Locations of `.so` Files**
Shared libraries are typically found in:
- `/lib`
- `/usr/lib`
- `/usr/local/lib`
- `/usr/lib64` (on 64-bit systems)

Example:
```bash
ls /usr/lib | grep .so
```

### **How to Use `.so` Files**
1. **Check Which Libraries a Program Uses**
   ```bash
   ldd /path/to/executable
   ```
   Example:
   ```bash
   ldd /bin/ls
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffc5d1f8000)
   libselinux.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007f6c5b000000)
   libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f6c5ac00000)
   ```

2. **Manually Load a Shared Library**
   ```bash
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/custom/path ./my_program
   ```
   or  
   ```bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/custom/path
   ```

3. **Check Dependencies of a `.so` File**
   ```bash
   objdump -p /usr/lib/libxyz.so
   ```

---

### **Example: Creating and Using a `.so` File**
#### **1. Create a Shared Library**
Write a simple C program (`math.c`):
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void hello() {
    printf("Hello from shared library!\n");
}
```

Compile it as a shared library:
```bash
gcc -shared -fPIC -o libmath.so math.c
```
- `-shared` â†’ Creates a shared object.
- `-fPIC` â†’ Generates position-independent code.

#### **2. Use the Shared Library**
Write another C program (`main.c`) to use the library:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

extern void hello();

int main() {
    hello();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile with the shared library:
```bash
gcc -o main main.c -L. -lmath
```
Run the program:
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./main
```
Output:
```
Hello from shared library!
```

### **Conclusion**
- **`.so` files** allow code reuse and efficient memory management.
- They are used by **Linux system libraries**, dynamically linked programs, and third-party applications.
- Developers can create and link against `.so` files using **GCC**.
