In the context of **cross-compilation**, the term "cross" refers to the idea of **crossing boundaries between systems**â€”specifically, building software on one system (the **build system**) that is intended to run on a different system (the **host system**).

For example:  
- If you compile a program on a **x86_64 Linux system** to run on a **ARM-based device**, this process "crosses" from one architecture (x86_64) to another (ARM).

### **Key Points about "Cross" in Cross-Compilation**
1. **Cross-Toolchain**: A set of tools (e.g., compiler, assembler, linker) that can generate executables for a platform different from the build system.  
   - Example: Building a compiler on your computer for an embedded ARM device.

2. **Build vs. Host vs. Target**:
   - **Build System**: The system where the compilation happens.
   - **Host System**: The system where the compiled program will run.
   - **Target System**: (Specific to compilers) The system for which the compiler generates code. This may differ from the host system.

3. **Isolation**: In LFS, cross-compilation is used to **isolate the build process** from the host system. Even though the "build" and "host" systems are the same machine in LFS, the cross-compilation method ensures the host environment doesn't interfere with the new system.

### Why Use Cross-Compilation in LFS?
Although LFS builds the new system on the same machine where it will run, cross-compilation:
- Ensures that no dependencies or configurations from the host system "leak" into the new system.
- Creates a clean, reproducible environment for building the new Linux system. 

This "cross" approach avoids reliance on the host system and allows greater control over the build process.
