### Note: Understanding `quiet splash` in GRUB Boot Parameters  

The `quiet splash` parameters are commonly found in the GRUB configuration of Linux distributions like Ubuntu. Here's what they do:  

- **`quiet`:** Suppresses detailed kernel messages during the boot process. Instead of displaying the verbose output (e.g., hardware checks, driver initialization, etc.), it keeps the screen clean by showing only critical messages (if any).  
- **`splash`:** Enables the graphical splash screen (e.g., the Ubuntu logo with a loading animation) to provide a more user-friendly and polished boot experience.  

These parameters are useful for creating a cleaner visual experience for end-users during system startup. However, they may hide important diagnostic information.  

**When to Remove or Modify `quiet splash`:**  
- For **troubleshooting** boot issues, removing `quiet splash` allows you to see detailed kernel logs during boot, which can help identify problems.  
- Replacing these with other boot parameters like `init=/bin/bash` can provide advanced access, such as booting directly into a root shell for system recovery tasks.  

You can temporarily modify these parameters in the GRUB menu without making permanent changes, making it a safe way to experiment or troubleshoot.
