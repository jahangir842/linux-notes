DNS propagation refers to the time it takes for changes made to a domain's DNS records to be updated and spread across all DNS servers worldwide. This process is necessary whenever you make changes to your DNS settings, such as updating nameservers, modifying DNS records (like A, CNAME, MX, etc.), or moving your domain to a new hosting provider.

### How DNS Works
When you type a domain name (like `example.com`) into your browser, your computer queries a DNS server to find out the IP address associated with that domain. DNS servers around the world cache this information to speed up future queries. This caching means that when you make changes to your DNS records, it can take some time for all DNS servers to update their cache with the new information.

### Factors Affecting DNS Propagation
1. **TTL (Time to Live) Settings**: 
   - Each DNS record has a TTL value, which tells DNS servers how long they should cache the information before checking for updates. Shorter TTL values can speed up propagation, but they also increase the load on your DNS servers.
   
2. **Global DNS Servers**:
   - DNS servers around the world may take different amounts of time to update their cache with your new DNS information. This is why, during propagation, some users may see the old version of your site, while others see the new one.

3. **ISP Caching**:
   - Internet Service Providers (ISPs) often cache DNS records to improve speed for their users. Some ISPs may take longer to update their cache, which can delay the propagation process for users on those networks.

### Typical DNS Propagation Time
- **24-48 hours** is a commonly cited timeframe for DNS propagation, but it can sometimes be faster or slower depending on the factors mentioned above.

### How to Check DNS Propagation
You can use online tools to check how your DNS changes are propagating across the globe. Examples include:
- [What's My DNS](https://www.whatsmydns.net/)
- [DNSChecker](https://dnschecker.org/)

These tools allow you to see which DNS servers have updated with your new DNS records and which ones are still showing the old records.

### What to Expect During DNS Propagation
- **Inconsistent Website Access**: Some visitors may see the old site, while others see the new one.
- **Email Delays**: If you're changing MX records for email, there may be delays in email delivery during propagation.
- **Temporary Downtime**: In some cases, you may experience brief periods of downtime as the new DNS information propagates.

Understanding DNS propagation is crucial when making DNS changes, as it helps you anticipate the time needed for changes to take full effect globally.
