### 🗂️ `lost+found` Directory in Linux Filesystems

#### 📌 What is `lost+found`?

- `lost+found` is a **special directory** automatically created at the **root of ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems**.
- It is used by **`fsck` (file system check)** to store recovered files or data fragments found during disk repair.

---

#### 🔧 When is it used?

- When a system crashes, power fails, or the filesystem is damaged, some files may lose their directory references.
- During recovery, `fsck` places these **orphaned files** into `lost+found` for manual inspection.

---

#### 🛠️ How is it created?

- Automatically generated by `mkfs.ext4` (or `mkfs.ext3`, `mkfs.ext2`) when formatting a new filesystem.
- Located in the **root of the filesystem**, e.g., `/mnt/backup/lost+found`.

---

#### ❌ Can I delete it?

- Not recommended.
- Deleting it doesn't harm the filesystem immediately, but it removes a useful tool for recovery.
- If deleted, it will usually be **recreated automatically** by `fsck` or on reboot (especially if a check is triggered).

---

#### ✅ Best Practice:

- **Leave `lost+found` alone.**
- If it contains files, inspect them carefully — they were recovered by `fsck` and may be important data fragments.
