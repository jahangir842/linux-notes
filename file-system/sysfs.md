### **What is sysfs in Linux?**
**sysfs** is a virtual file system in Linux that provides a structured way to access kernel objects and hardware information. It is mounted at **`/sys`** and serves as an interface between the kernel and user space, allowing system administrators and applications to query and configure hardware settings dynamically.

## **Key Features of sysfs**
1. **Represents Kernel Objects as Files**  
   - Exposes information about devices, drivers, and kernel subsystems in a hierarchical format.
   - Each file corresponds to a kernel parameter that can often be read or modified.

2. **Provides a Unified View of System Hardware**  
   - Device attributes such as **CPU, memory, network interfaces, and block devices** are accessible via `/sys`.

3. **Supports Dynamic Configuration**  
   - Unlike `/proc`, which primarily provides process-related information, `/sys` allows for **real-time changes** to device settings.

## **Where is sysfs Located?**
- By default, sysfs is mounted at **`/sys`**:
  ```bash
  mount | grep sysfs
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
  ```

- You can manually mount it if needed:
  ```bash
  mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
  ```

## **Example Use Cases**
1. **Checking Available CPUs**  
   ```bash
   cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/online
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   0-7
   ```
   (Shows CPUs from `0` to `7` are online)

2. **Getting CPU Frequency**  
   ```bash
   cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
   ```
   Output (in kHz):
   ```
   2800000
   ```
   (Means **2.8 GHz** for `cpu0`)

3. **Listing All Block Devices (Disks, Partitions, etc.)**  
   ```bash
   ls /sys/block/
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   sda  sda1  sda2  sdb  sdb1
   ```

4. **Checking Battery Status (Laptops only)**  
   ```bash
   cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   Charging
   ```

## **sysfs vs. Other Virtual File Systems**
| **File System** | **Mount Point** | **Purpose** |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| **procfs (`proc`)** | `/proc` | Process and kernel runtime info |
| **sysfs (`sys`)** | `/sys` | Hardware and device configuration |
| **devfs (`dev`)** | `/dev` | Device nodes for hardware access |
| **tmpfs (`tmp`)** | `/tmp`, `/run` | Temporary in-memory storage |

---

## **Conclusion**
sysfs is an essential virtual file system that exposes kernel and hardware details in an organized, user-friendly way. It is widely used for hardware monitoring, system debugging, and real-time configuration changes.
