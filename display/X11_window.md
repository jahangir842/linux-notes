### **What is an X11-Based System?**  
An **X11-based system** refers to a graphical user interface (GUI) system that uses the **X Window System (X11)** for managing windows, displays, and input devices on Unix-like operating systems, including **Linux and BSD**.

### **What is X11?**
- **X11 (X Window System, version 11)** is a **display server protocol** that provides the basic framework for building GUIs.
- It was developed in the **1980s** at MIT and is still widely used, though it's gradually being replaced by **Wayland**.
- X11 allows multiple applications to open windows, draw graphics, and receive user input (keyboard & mouse) in a **network-transparent** way (it can run applications remotely over a network).

### **Key Components of an X11-Based System**
1. **X Server** – Manages displays and input devices.
   - Examples: **Xorg (X.Org Server)** (most common), XFree86 (older).
  
2. **X Clients** – GUI applications (e.g., Firefox, Terminal, VSCode) that connect to the X server.

3. **Window Manager (WM)** – Controls window behavior, decorations, and placement.
   - Examples: **Openbox, Fluxbox, i3, AwesomeWM**.

4. **Desktop Environment (DE)** (Optional) – A full-featured user environment on top of X11.
   - Examples: **GNOME, KDE Plasma, Xfce, LXQt**.

### **Examples of X11-Based Systems**
- **Ubuntu (with Xorg session)**
- **Debian, Fedora, Arch Linux (when using Xorg)**
- **FreeBSD (with Xorg)**
- **Older macOS versions (before macOS removed XQuartz by default)**

### **X11 vs. Wayland**
| Feature        | X11  | Wayland |
|---------------|------|---------|
| Age           | 1984 | 2008    |
| Performance   | Can be slow | Faster, less latency |
| Security      | Less secure (clients can spy on each other) | Better security model |
| Remote Access | Strong (via SSH/X forwarding) | Limited (currently) |
| Compositing   | Optional (can be disabled) | Always enabled |

- **Wayland** is the modern replacement for X11, but X11 is still widely used.

### **How to Check if You’re Using X11**
Run:
```bash
echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
```
- Output **`x11`** → You are using X11.
- Output **`wayland`** → You are using Wayland.
