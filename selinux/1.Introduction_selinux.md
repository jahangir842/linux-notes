### SELinux

**SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)** is a security module that provides a robust and flexible mechanism for enforcing security policies on Linux-based systems. It is integrated into RHEL-based systems (such as RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux, etc.) and helps mitigate security risks by controlling how processes and users interact with the system’s resources.

### General Overview of SELinux:

1. **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):**
   SELinux is based on the concept of *Mandatory Access Control* (MAC). This means that access controls are enforced by the system rather than the users or administrators, and they are not easily bypassed.

2. **Security Contexts:**
   Every file, process, and resource in SELinux is assigned a *security context*, which defines how it can interact with other system objects. Security contexts consist of three parts:
   - **User**: Defines the user role (e.g., `system_u`).
   - **Role**: Defines the role of the process or object (e.g., `object_r` or `user_r`).
   - **Type**: Defines the type or class of the object (e.g., `httpd_t` for a web server).

3. **Policy Rules:**
   SELinux operates based on a set of policies that define which actions are permitted and denied. These policies control file access, process interactions, network usage, etc., and can be customized to fit specific security needs.

4. **Modes of Operation:**
   SELinux can run in three different modes:
   - **Enforcing**: SELinux policies are enforced, and access is either allowed or denied based on the policy.
   - **Permissive**: SELinux does not enforce policies but logs violations for auditing purposes.
   - **Disabled**: SELinux is completely turned off, and no security policies are enforced.

### Detailed Explanation of SELinux:

#### 1. **SELinux Architecture**

   - **Policy Module**: A collection of rules that define the security context and actions in SELinux. These rules govern interactions between system processes and resources.
   - **Security Contexts**: SELinux assigns security contexts to every file, process, and resource. The security context is used to determine what access is allowed. For example, a web server process (`httpd_t`) will have a security context that grants it access only to the files and resources necessary for serving web content.

   SELinux security contexts are composed of:
   - **user** (e.g., `system_u`)
   - **role** (e.g., `object_r`)
   - **type** (e.g., `httpd_t` for web-related files)
   - **level** (optional, used for multi-level security)

#### 2. **Security Policies**

   SELinux’s policies are defined using a language that describes how resources interact. These policies are pre-configured by the system and can be customized. Policies dictate what actions are allowed between different types of processes, files, users, and other objects.

   For example, an HTTP server (`httpd_t`) might only have read/write access to files in the `/var/www/html/` directory. This prevents processes like an FTP server from accessing these files, even if they run as the same user.

#### 3. **SELinux Modes**

   - **Enforcing Mode**: In this mode, SELinux enforces its policy strictly, denying access to resources based on the rules. Any action not explicitly permitted by the policy is blocked. This is the default mode in RHEL-based systems.
   
   - **Permissive Mode**: In permissive mode, SELinux does not deny access. Instead, it logs any violations (denied actions) for later review. This is useful for debugging and testing new policies.
   
   - **Disabled Mode**: In this mode, SELinux is turned off completely, and no policies are enforced. This mode is typically used for troubleshooting or in cases where SELinux conflicts with system requirements.

   **To check the current mode** of SELinux, you can run the following command:
   ```bash
   getenforce
   ```

   - **To change the mode** temporarily (until reboot):
   ```bash
   sudo setenforce 1  # Enforcing
   sudo setenforce 0  # Permissive
   ```

   - **To permanently change the SELinux mode**, you need to edit the configuration file `/etc/selinux/config` and modify the `SELINUX` line:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/selinux/config
   ```
   Modify the line:
   ```plaintext
   SELINUX=enforcing
   ```
   Options: `enforcing`, `permissive`, or `disabled`.

#### 4. **Key SELinux Tools**

   - **`getenforce`**: Displays the current SELinux mode (enforcing, permissive, or disabled).
   - **`setenforce`**: Used to change the SELinux mode temporarily.
   - **`sestatus`**: Provides detailed status about SELinux, including mode, policy, and context.
   - **`semanage`**: Used for managing SELinux policy configurations, like adding new policies.
   - **`chcon`**: Used to change the security context of a file or resource.
   - **`restorecon`**: Used to restore the default security contexts to files.

#### 5. **SELinux Troubleshooting**

   - If SELinux is blocking legitimate operations, the **audit logs** can help identify the issue. You can view the logs using the `ausearch` or `sealert` commands:
     ```bash
     sudo ausearch -m avc -ts recent
     sudo sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log
     ```

   - **Creating custom policies**: In case of access denials, you can create custom policies to allow the required actions.

   - **`audit2allow`**: This tool can be used to generate SELinux policy modules to resolve access denials:
     ```bash
     sudo audit2allow -a -M mycustompolicy
     sudo semodule -i mycustompolicy.pp
     ```

#### 6. **SELinux Use Cases**

   - **Web Servers**: SELinux helps secure web server applications (like Apache or Nginx) by ensuring that they only have access to the necessary directories and files.
   - **Database Servers**: SELinux ensures that database processes (like MySQL) do not have access to sensitive or unrelated files.
   - **Containers and Virtualization**: SELinux is also used to manage security in containerized environments, such as Docker or Kubernetes, by isolating container processes.

#### 7. **SELinux Policy Types**

   SELinux policies can be broadly divided into three types:
   - **Targeted Policy**: The most common policy, which targets specific processes for confinement (e.g., web servers, database servers).
   - **MLS (Multi-Level Security) Policy**: Used for high-security environments where different levels of clearance exist, and access to resources is based on security clearance levels.
   - **MCS (Multi-Category Security) Policy**: A more flexible version of MLS, used to assign different access levels to processes, users, and files.

#### 8. **SELinux Troubleshooting Example**

   - If a process, like an HTTP server, cannot access a directory, SELinux may be blocking it. In this case, the `audit2allow` tool can help you generate a policy module that allows the action, as shown earlier.

### Summary:
**SELinux** is a critical security feature in RHEL-based systems that uses *Mandatory Access Control* (MAC) to enforce strict access policies across the system. It helps prevent unauthorized access by limiting the resources that processes can interact with. SELinux operates in different modes (enforcing, permissive, disabled) and can be configured with customized policies to suit specific security needs. While it can be complex to manage, SELinux greatly enhances system security by restricting applications to only the resources they require.
