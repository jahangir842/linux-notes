## **`vi` and `vim` Editor Overview**

`vi` is a classic text editor in Unix-based systems, while `vim` is an enhanced version of `vi`, offering additional functionality like syntax highlighting, multiple undo levels, and plugins. Both editors operate in **modes**, which can be confusing for beginners but offer great flexibility once understood.

### **1. Normal Mode (Default Mode)**

When you open a file in `vi` or `vim`, you are in **Normal Mode**. In this mode, you can navigate, delete, and manipulate text without actually editing the content.

#### **Common Commands in Normal Mode**

- **Navigation**:
  - **`h`**: Move the cursor left
  - **`j`**: Move the cursor down
  - **`k`**: Move the cursor up
  - **`l`**: Move the cursor right

  - **`b`**: Jump back to the start of the previous word
  - **`0`**: Move to the beginning of the current line
  - **`$`**: Move to the end of the current line
  - **`gg`**: Go to the beginning of the file
  - **`G`**: Go to the end of the file

- **Editing and Deletion**:
  - **`x`**: Delete the character under the cursor
  - **`dw`**: Delete the word starting from the cursor
  - **`dd`**: Delete the entire line
  - **`d$`**: Delete from the cursor to the end of the line
  - **`u`**: Undo the last change
  - **`Ctrl + r`**: Redo the last undone action
  - **`p`**: Paste the copied or deleted text after the cursor
  - **`yy`**: Yank (copy) the entire line
  - **`y`**: Yank selected text or portion

- **Search**:
  - **`/pattern`**: Search for `pattern` in the file
  - **`n`**: Move to the next occurrence of the search result

Normal Mode is the mode for quick edits and navigation. If you’re in any other mode, press **`Esc`** to return to Normal Mode.

### **2. Insert Mode**

This mode allows you to insert or modify text. It’s similar to the text editing modes in modern editors like VS Code or Sublime.

#### **Switching to Insert Mode**

- **`i`**: Insert before the cursor
- **`a`**: Insert after the cursor
- **`I`**: Insert at the beginning of the current line
- **`A`**: Insert at the end of the current line
- **`o`**: Open a new line below and enter Insert Mode
- **`O`**: Open a new line above and enter Insert Mode

#### **Exiting Insert Mode**

- Press **`Esc`** to return to Normal Mode.

### **3. Command Mode (Ex Mode)**

Command Mode is used to perform tasks like saving the file, quitting `vim`, or performing complex search-and-replace operations. You enter Command Mode by typing **`:`** from Normal Mode.

#### **Common Commands in Command Mode**:

- **Saving and Quitting**:
  - **`:w`**: Save the file
  - **`:q`**: Quit `vim`
  - **`:wq`** or **`:x`**: Save and quit
  - **`:q!`**: Quit without saving

- **File Operations**:
  - **`:e filename`**: Open another file
  - **`:r filename`**: Read another file into the current file

- **Search and Replace**:
  - **`:%s/old/new/g`**: Replace all occurrences of `old` with `new` in the file
  - **`:%s/old/new/gc`**: Replace all occurrences but ask for confirmation before each change

- **Line Numbers**:
  - **`:set number`**: Show line numbers
  - **`:set nonumber`**: Hide line numbers

You can execute many more complex commands using Command Mode. To return to Normal Mode from Command Mode, press **`Esc`**.

### **4. Visual Mode**

In Visual Mode, you can select text for copying, cutting, or other actions.

#### **Types of Visual Mode**:

- **`v`**: Character-wise selection
- **`V`**: Line-wise selection
- **`Ctrl + v`**: Block selection (visual block mode)

#### **Common Visual Mode Commands**:

- **`p`**: Paste the copied text after the selection

To exit Visual Mode, press **`Esc`**.

### **5. Advanced `vim` Features**

#### **Multiple Undo Levels**
Unlike `vi`, which only supports one undo, `vim` allows multiple undo actions:
- **`u`**: Undo the last change
- **`Ctrl + r`**: Redo an undone action

#### **Split Windows**
You can split your screen to work on multiple files or parts of a file simultaneously:
- **`:split filename`**: Split the screen horizontally
- **`:vsplit filename`**: Split the screen vertically
- **`Ctrl + w, w`**: Switch between windows

#### **Macros**
You can record and replay macros in `vim`:
- **`qa`**: Start recording into register `a`
- Perform actions.
- **`q`**: Stop recording
- **`@a`**: Play back the macro in register `a`

#### **Configuration (`.vimrc`)**
To make `vim` behave the way you like, you can customize it through a configuration file, `.vimrc`. For example:
```bash
set number        # Show line numbers
set tabstop=4     # Set tab width to 4 spaces
set expandtab     # Use spaces instead of tabs
set mouse=a       # Enable mouse usage in all modes
syntax on         # Enable syntax highlighting
```

### **Conclusion**

Learning `vim` can feel overwhelming at first because of its multiple modes and extensive command set. However, once you master the basic navigation and editing commands in Normal Mode, and you get comfortable switching to Insert, Command, and Visual Modes, your productivity in `vim` will increase significantly. Keep practicing these commands and consider customizing `vim` with `.vimrc` settings to suit your workflow.
