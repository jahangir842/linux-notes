UUID stands for **Universally Unique Identifier**. Itâ€™s a 128-bit number used to uniquely identify information in computer systems. UUIDs are designed to be unique across both time and space, meaning that no two UUIDs should be the same, even if generated on different systems or at different times.

### Key Features of UUIDs:

1. **Uniqueness**: The probability of generating the same UUID is extremely low, making them suitable for unique identifiers.

2. **Format**: A UUID is typically represented as a string of 32 hexadecimal digits, displayed in five groups separated by hyphens, like this: `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`.

3. **Versions**: There are several versions of UUIDs, each with different methods of generation:
   - **Version 1**: Based on time and the machine's MAC address.
   - **Version 3**: Generated using a namespace and a name, employing MD5 hashing.
   - **Version 4**: Randomly generated, providing a good balance between uniqueness and simplicity.
   - **Version 5**: Similar to version 3 but uses SHA-1 hashing.

### Common Uses:

- **Database Keys**: UUIDs are often used as primary keys in databases to ensure unique identification of records.
- **Distributed Systems**: They help identify objects across different machines without collisions.
- **File Identifiers**: Used in various applications to track files uniquely.

In summary, UUIDs are a powerful tool for ensuring uniqueness in various computing contexts. If you have more specific questions about UUIDs or their usage, feel free to ask!
