# pfSense Firewall

## **Introduction**

**pfSense** is an open-source firewall and router software distribution based on FreeBSD. It provides a robust, flexible, and scalable solution for network security and management. pfSense can be used for various purposes, including network firewalling, VPN services, load balancing, and more.

## **Key Features**

1. **Firewall and NAT**: Advanced filtering capabilities and network address translation (NAT) to control network traffic.
2. **VPN**: Supports various VPN technologies, including IPsec, OpenVPN, and L2TP.
3. **Routing**: Static and dynamic routing protocols like OSPF, BGP, and RIP.
4. **Traffic Shaping**: Bandwidth management and quality of service (QoS).
5. **Intrusion Detection and Prevention**: Integration with Snort or Suricata for network threat detection.
6. **High Availability**: Supports failover and redundancy with CARP (Common Address Redundancy Protocol).
7. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Comprehensive monitoring tools and reporting options.
8. **User Authentication**: Integration with LDAP, RADIUS, and other authentication services.

## **Installation**

### **Requirements**

- **Hardware**: A compatible PC or virtual machine with at least 1 GB RAM, 4 GB disk space, and two network interfaces.
- **Media**: A bootable USB stick or CD/DVD with the pfSense image.

### **Steps to Install pfSense**

1. **Download pfSense**: Go to the [pfSense website](https://www.pfsense.org/download/) and download the appropriate image for your hardware (e.g., USB memstick installer for USB installation).

2. **Create Bootable Media**:
   - For USB: Use tools like Rufus (Windows) or `dd` command (Linux/macOS) to create a bootable USB drive.
   - For CD/DVD: Burn the ISO image to a CD/DVD.

3. **Boot from Media**: Insert the bootable media into your system and boot from it.

4. **Install pfSense**:
   - Select the option to install pfSense from the boot menu.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to choose the installation disk and configure partitions.
   - After installation, remove the bootable media and reboot the system.

5. **Initial Configuration**:
   - On the first boot, youâ€™ll be guided through the setup process using a console interface.
   - Assign interfaces (WAN, LAN) and configure basic network settings.

## **Basic Configuration**

### **Accessing the Web Interface**

1. **Connect to the LAN Interface**: Ensure your computer is connected to the LAN interface of pfSense.
2. **Open a Web Browser**: Navigate to `http://192.168.1.1` (default IP address).
3. **Login**: Use the default username (`admin`) and password (`pfsense`).

### **Initial Setup Wizard**

1. **General Setup**:
   - Configure the hostname, domain, and primary DNS server.
2. **Interfaces**:
   - Set up WAN and LAN interfaces with appropriate IP settings.
3. **Set Admin Password**:
   - Change the default password to secure the web interface.

### **Firewall Rules**

1. **Navigate to Firewall Rules**: Go to `Firewall` > `Rules`.
2. **Add Rules**:
   - Define rules to allow or block traffic based on source, destination, and protocol.
   - Example: To allow HTTP traffic from LAN to WAN, create a rule allowing traffic on port 80.

## **Advanced Configuration**

### **VPN Setup**

- **OpenVPN**:
  - Go to `VPN` > `OpenVPN` to set up an OpenVPN server or client.
  - Configure server settings, client export options, and firewall rules for VPN traffic.

- **IPsec**:
  - Navigate to `VPN` > `IPsec` to configure IPsec tunnels.
  - Set up Phase 1 and Phase 2 settings for site-to-site or remote access VPNs.

### **Traffic Shaping**

1. **Navigate to Traffic Shaper**: Go to `Firewall` > `Traffic Shaper`.
2. **Setup**:
   - Use the wizard to define traffic shaping rules based on bandwidth, priority, and queueing.

### **High Availability**

- **CARP (Common Address Redundancy Protocol)**:
  - Go to `Firewall` > `Virtual IPs` to configure CARP virtual IPs.
  - Set up multiple pfSense instances to provide failover and load balancing.

### **Monitoring and Logging**

1. **System Logs**:
   - Access logs at `Status` > `System Logs` to view firewall, system, and VPN logs.
2. **Monitoring Tools**:
   - Use tools like `Status` > `Dashboard` to monitor system performance and network traffic.

## **Security Best Practices**

1. **Update Regularly**: Keep pfSense updated with the latest security patches.
2. **Change Default Credentials**: Always change default passwords and use strong credentials.
3. **Backup Configuration**: Regularly backup pfSense configurations to restore settings in case of failure.
4. **Implement Access Controls**: Restrict web interface access to trusted IP addresses.
5. **Configure Intrusion Detection**: Use Snort or Suricata for additional network security.

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Connectivity Issues**:
  - Check interface settings and cable connections.
  - Use tools like `ping` and `traceroute` from the Diagnostics menu.

- **Firewall Rules**:
  - Verify rule order and ensure rules are not unintentionally blocking traffic.

- **Logs**:
  - Review system and firewall logs for error messages or unusual activity.

## **Conclusion**

pfSense is a versatile and powerful firewall and router solution suitable for a wide range of network environments. By following these notes, you can effectively install, configure, and manage pfSense to meet your network security and management needs.
